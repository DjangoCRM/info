## What Makes Django CRM Different?

**Django-CRM** is a customer relationship management CRM solution designed with **two primary goals**:

- **For business users**: Deliver a professional-grade open-source CRM software with all the tools needed to manage customers, sales, and workflows — completely free and under an open source license.  
- **For maintainers and developers**: To make it significantly easier to:

    - customize the software
    - deploy and support of a production server
    - develop and extend functionality

**The proprietary framework was not intentionally created**: everything is built using the popular Django framework.  
CRM also takes full advantage of the Django Admin site, with documentation all contained on a single web page!  
Client Relationship Management software is built for individual use by businesses of any size or freelancers and is designed to provide easy customization and quick development. Access to the company's business data remains solely under its control.  
**This CRM is ideal for businesses that want full control over their CRM solution without vendor lock-in.**

Over time, CRM systems inevitably **accumulate large volumes of data** across leads, contacts, tasks, and interactions. A **tabular presentation** with flexible filtering and sorting options helps users **quickly locate relevant records**, analyze key details, and manage daily operations efficiently—even as the dataset grows. This format supports faster decision-making and reduces the time spent navigating complex information.
