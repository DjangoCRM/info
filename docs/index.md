## **What Makes Django CRM Different?**

**Django-CRM** is a customer relationship management CRM solution designed with **two primary goals**:

- **For business users**: Deliver a professional-grade open-source CRM software with all the tools needed to manage customers, sales, and workflows — completely free and under an open source license.  
- **For maintainers and developers**: To make it significantly easier to:

    - customize the software
    - deploy and support of a production server
    - develop and extend functionality

Access to the company's business data remains solely under its control.  
**This CRM is perfect for businesses that want full control over their CRM solution without vendor lock-in.**

Django CRM is built entirely on the widely used [Django Admin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/){target="_blank"} framework. This means most
[Python](https://www.python.org/){target="_blank"}/Django developers and integrators can easily understand, customize, and extend the system — reducing
implementation time and long-term maintenance expenses compared to similar products.

Over time, CRM systems inevitably **accumulate large volumes of data** across leads, contacts, tasks, and interactions. A **tabular presentation** with flexible filtering and sorting options helps users **quickly locate relevant records**, analyze key details, and manage daily operations efficiently—even as the dataset grows. This format supports faster decision-making and reduces the time spent navigating complex information.

!!! note "**Common Problems Faced by SaaS CRM Clients**"

    ??? info "1. High Subscription Costs with Low Feature Utilization"

          * Companies pay large annual fees for SaaS CRM licenses.
          * Typically, only 20-30% of the features are actually used.
          * Useful features are often locked behind expensive “premium” tiers.
    
    ??? info "2. Rigid workflows that don't match business needs"
    
          * SaaS platforms force businesses to adapt their workflows to fit predefined CRM structures.
          * Customizing business logic (e.g., lead scoring algorithms) requires expensive plugins, consultants, or workarounds.
          * Built-in tools are generic and often fail to handle industry-specific needs.
    
    ??? info "3. Customizations break during platform updates and Vendor Lock-in"
    
          * Custom features or integrations often break with each platform update.
          * Migration to another platform is made intentionally difficult and costly.
          * Companies become trapped into paying increasing subscription fees due to the complexity of switching.
    
    ??? info "4. Hidden Costs: Integration, Consulting, and Manual Work"
    
          * Integrating third-party tools or internal systems comes with high consulting costs.
          * Teams waste time on manual processes (data exports, custom reports) because automation is limited or broken.
          * Productivity losses are not accounted for in ROI calculations but have a real business impact.
    
    ??? info "5. Slow Response to Unique Requirements"
    
          * Feature requests or necessary changes depend on vendor development timelines.
          * Critical business requirements are often low priority for large CRM vendors.
          * Businesses are left waiting or forced into costly custom development on top of already expensive platforms.

!!! question "**How Django CRM Solves These Problems**"

    ??? success "1. Free, open-source software with no per-user costs"

          * Django CRM is **free, open-source software**—no license fees, no per-user costs.
          * You fully own the codebase and data, with no vendor lock-in.
          * Initial development costs can be recovered over time through lower operating expenses.

    ??? success "2. Fully customizable data models and logic"

          * Django CRM allows you to **modify the CRM’s logic and data models directly**.
          * You can implement custom lead scoring, unique sales processes, or niche workflows tailored to your industry.
          * No need to patch together external tools or bend your process to fit generic CRM templates.

    ??? success "3. Stable Customizations that You Control in your own CRM"

          * You decide when and how to update your CRM.
          * Custom features are part of your codebase—not fragile external plugins that break during vendor updates.
          * Migration is always possible since the entire application is under your control.

    ??? success "4. Efficient Integrations via Django/Python Ecosystem"

          * Django’s modular architecture makes API integrations and automation straightforward.
          * You avoid proprietary “integration marketplaces” with hidden fees.
          * Internal systems, custom dashboards, and automation scripts can all run seamlessly within the same tech stack.

    ??? success "5. Agile Response to Business Needs"

          * Development cycles are determined by your team, not a vendor’s roadmap.
          * New features can be added incrementally, exactly when they are needed.
          * Django CRM is built to be **extended**, making it ideal for evolving business requirements.
