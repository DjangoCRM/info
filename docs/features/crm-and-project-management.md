# **CRM and Project Management in Django CRM**

The [free, open-source **Django CRM**](../index.md) combines CRM and project management in one integrated platform.
It allows teams to manage customer relationships and internal work processes without switching between separate tools.

Within Django CRM, projects are organized around [tasks](tasks-app-features.md) and subtasks, making it easy to plan,
delegate, and track progress at every stage. Users can create projects for client work, internal initiatives,
or departmental goals — all within the same environment they use for lead and deal management.

Because projects in Django CRM share the same structure as tasks, users benefit from a unified approach
to tracking responsibilities, deadlines, and outcomes. Each project can include multiple task owners,
assignees, and related files, giving teams full visibility into both operational and client-focused activities.

This integration of CRM and project management software streamlines workflows, reduces duplication of effort,
and ensures that all information — from client data to project progress — remains connected and accessible in one system.
