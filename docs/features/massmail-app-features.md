# Boost Sales Efficiency with Integrated Email Marketing: Send Personalized email Campaigns Directly from the CRM 

The **Massmail application** is a built-in feature of the CRM that enables your team to manage and send email campaigns. It‚Äôs designed for sales managers who need to communicate with leads, contacts, and companies efficiently‚Äîwithout leaving their workflow.

## Built for CRM-Based Outreach

Massmail works within your existing CRM data. You can send emails to contacts already in the system, using your assigned mailing account. Each sales manager has access only to their recipients and can use only the email accounts linked to their profile.

Massmail requires:

* A list of recipients in the CRM database
* Email accounts marked for mass mailing

To protect deliverability, mail from the primary sales manager account is sent only to VIP recipients.

## Control and Flexibility

You can choose how to build your mailing list:

* **Quick method**: Select recipients from any list view (e.g., companies or leads), and create a mailing directly via the Action menu.
* **Advanced method**: Use the ‚ÄúCreate Mailing‚Äù button to apply filters and generate a targeted list‚Äîideal when working with a large number of records.

You can also define working hours for sending emails to avoid off-hours delivery. These hours are configurable.

Here‚Äôs how you can incorporate a **visual block** to highlight the use of dynamic tags in personalized messages. This block is styled to fit a modern marketing page and can be easily adapted into your site's design system:

## Personalized Messages

Massmail allows your team to send messages that feel individual‚Äîeven at scale.

Before sending a campaign, sales managers prepare the message content and select a signature. Each manager can maintain a personal library of signatures tailored to different scenarios, such as cold outreach, follow-ups, or special offers.

To enhance engagement, message templates can include dynamic tags that automatically insert each recipient‚Äôs personal details. This allows you to craft messages like:

### üì® Example Template

```
Hi {{ first_name }},

We noticed your interest in our services and wanted to follow up with some tailored options.

```

### ‚úÖ How it looks when sent

```
Hi Emma,

We noticed your interest in our services and wanted to follow up with some tailored options.

Best regards,  
John Smith  
Sales Manager
```

These tags‚Äîsuch as **{{ first_name }}**, **{{ last_name }}**, **{{ company }}**, and more‚Äîare replaced with real data pulled directly from your CRM. This saves time and ensures that every message feels relevant and personalized.

Every message also includes an unsubscribe link, helping you stay compliant with communication standards and giving recipients full control over their preferences.

### Tracking Replies in the CRM Software

To reduce noise, CRM software automatically imports only the emails linked to commercial Requests and Deals‚Äîthese are organized using a ticketing system. If a recipient replies to a newsletter with a commercial inquiry, that message can be imported manually with one click, and the rest of the thread will be tracked automatically.

The system also supports OAuth 2.0, so you can connect accounts that require two-step authentication.
