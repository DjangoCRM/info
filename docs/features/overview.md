## Key Features common to all CRM Applications

### Filters and Sorting

- **Filter Panel**: The filter panel, located on the right side of each object list page, allows users to narrow down the displayed data.  
  Some filters come with default values (e.g., only showing active tasks). Filters can be customized and saved for future use.
- **Advanced Sorting**: In addition to basic sorting by column headers, users can apply multi-level sorting for more complex data views.  
  For instance, tasks can be sorted first by due date and then by priority level.
  
### Object Identification and Search

- **ID-Based Search**: Objects can be quickly located by entering "ID" followed by the object's number (e.g., ID1234).
- **Ticket-Based Search**: Commercial requests and related objects as Emails, Deals, etc. can be found by their unique ticket identifier by typing "ticket:" followed by the value (e.g., ticket:tWRMaat3n8Y).
- **Automatic Search Algorithms**: The CRM uses several identifiers (e.g., first name, email, phone number) to match and link objects, such as requests to companies and contact persons.  
  The system automatically suggests related entities during searches.
