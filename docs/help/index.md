## **Getting Started**

Django CRM is a web-based system available on any device with a browser. It is optimized for smartphones and tablets, so you can work with it without installing additional applications.

* To access the CRM, use the login page address provided by your CRM administrator.
* Your login credentials (username and password) are also issued by the administrator.

---

## **User Access and Permissions**

Access to CRM sections depends on your user role. If you don’t see a certain page, feature, or piece of data, it may be restricted by your current permissions.
In this case, please contact your CRM administrator to request the necessary access.

---

## **Useful Tools in the Interface**

In the upper-right corner of every CRM page, you can:

* **Open Help** – jump directly to the help page for the section you are working in.
* **Change Language** – select from over 20 available interface languages. You can switch languages at any time.
* **Switch Theme** – choose between a brighter or darker interface theme for comfortable work.
