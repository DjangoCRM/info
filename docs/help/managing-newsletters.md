# **Managing Newsletters in Django CRM**

The **Newsletter Management** page in [mailing CRM](../index.md) allows marketing and sales teams to create,
edit, organize, and reuse email content for mass mailing, [email marketing](../features/massmail-app-features.md),
and customer communication campaigns. This section helps you  keep communication consistent,
reuse existing email templates, and maintain a structured library of all outgoing messages within the mailing CRM module.

## **Overview of the Newsletter List**

A list of all the newsletters available to you, which you are allowed to access
based on your user role and department, will be presented in the table.

- **Sales managers** can view and manage newsletters created within their department.
- **Company managers** have full access to email messages across all departments.

This ensures secure, role-based access while enabling collaboration inside teams.
The table supports sorting and search to help you quickly navigate large collections of messages.

### Table Columns

Each newsletter is displayed with essential details:

- **Name and preview** – the title of the email and a short preview.
- **Owner** –  the assigned sales manager or message creator.
- **Update date** – when the email was last modified.
- **Newsletter ID** – a unique identifier for system tracking and search.

You can sort most columns simply by clicking their header.

## **Creating a New Newsletter**

To create a new email newsletter:

1. Click **“Add Email Message”**.
2. Complete the required fields in the message form.
3. Save your newsletter so it becomes available for future mass mailing campaigns.

Before sending email messages, ensure that:

- You have at least one email account configured for sending newsletters.
- You have set up a personal email signature for consistent branding and communication.

## **Copying an Existing Newsletter**

To accelerate content creation and maintain consistent branding, you can use an existing email as a template:

- Click the **copy icon** next to the message you want to reuse.
- The system will duplicate it, allowing you to adjust text, links, and images.

If you want to copy a newsletter created by another user:

1. Use the **Owner filter** to select that user.
2. Find the message you want to reuse.
3. Click the **copy icon** next to the message.

This feature is especially useful for maintaining consistent branding and message structure across departments.

## Searching for Newsletters

The **search bar** supports quick filtering by:

- Keywords in the subject or body of the email
- **Newsletter ID**

This makes it easy to locate older newsletters or check whether a message already exists before creating a new one.
