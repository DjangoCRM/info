# **Deleting Tasks**

In the CRM, tasks are typically **not deleted after completion**.
If you are listed as a task **assignee**, simply **mark the task as completed**  in your [task manager](task-management.md) —
it will automatically disappear from your active task list but remain stored in the database.
Keeping completed tasks in the system is considered a good practice, as it allows you to retain task history, track performance, and maintain accurate reporting.

## **Who Can Delete a Task**

Only the **task owner** (the user who created the task) or a **co-owner** can delete it.
If you are not the owner or co-owner, the Delete button will not be available on the [task edit page](editing-updating-tasks.md).

## **How to Delete a Task**

To delete a task:

1. Open the task edit page.
2. Click **Delete** at the bottom of the page.
3. A **confirmation page** will appear showing what will be deleted.

This page includes two sections:

- **Summary** — displays a breakdown of the number of deleted objects by type.
- **Objects** — lists all the specific items that will be deleted, with clickable links for you to review before confirming.

## **What Gets Deleted**

When a task is deleted, all related data is removed along with it, including:

- Subtasks
- Attached files
- Task–user relationships (note: the users themselves are not deleted)

Deleting a task is **permanent** — once confirmed, it cannot be undone.
If you only want to remove a task from your active workflow, it’s safer to **mark it as completed** instead.

For general task management guidance, see the [CRM Task Management](../features/tasks-app-features.md) help page.
